### Background
You wake up on a spaceship, surrounded by nine other people. An alien informs you that she and her alien comrades would like to eat you all.

Before you panic and scream, she informs you that they do not wish to eat the group if the group can demonstrate that it has a decent level of logic, cunning and reasoning. That would otherwise by inhumane.

As such the aliens have devised a test, which, should you all pass, will allow you to beam safely back to earth.

### The Test
They will arrange the group in a line all facing forwards. You will be arranged in height order such that the person at the back can see the hats on the heads of everyone ahead of them, but not their own. The next person will be able to see the hats on the heads of everyone ahead of _them_, but not their own or of the person behind them etc.

The chief alien will go down the line from the back to the front, asking each person what colour hat they are wearing. Each person can say one of "Black" or "White" and nothing else.

If your group gets anything less than 90% accuracy, you will all be eaten. The chief alien informs you that they will be placing you all in this test in the morning and so you all have some time to come up with a strategy.

What is your strategy?

### FAQ
> Can they say "Black" quietly to indicate X?

No. Each person can indicate only "White" or "Black". It could just as easily be them pressing a button in front of them that flashes up the word on a screen for everyone to see.
