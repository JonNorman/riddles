### Get your riddle on
A lot of riddles require that the riddlees determine some strategy that the agents in the riddle should adopt in order to win/avoid death.

A recent riddling at lunchtime left me with the desire to be able to code up this strategy and test it against the scenarios in the riddle.

This repository is designed to provide lots of little riddles, each expressed in Scala, that can then be "solved" by completing the stub indicated in the respective riddle files.

### How to run
Once the riddle has been answered (by writing the body of the `answer` method stub), simply run `sbt` from the project directory, once in SBT run `project <riddle_name>` and finally `test`.
